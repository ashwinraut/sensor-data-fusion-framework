# sensor-fusion-framework

A framework to enable multi sensor fusion on Embedded devices.

The framework is intented to support multiple platforms , RTOS , Linux etc.

For use in small low power embedded devices like wearables to large embedded devices like Autonomous vehicles.

Framework will be able to support any kind of sensor stream for example:
Motion Sensors - Accel , Gyro , Mag
Light Sensors - Ambient light etc.
Health Sensors - PPG , ECG , Bio Impedance etc.
Autonomous vehicles sensors - Camera , LiDar etc.
UV sensors , Temperature sensor.
